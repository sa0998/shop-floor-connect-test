- headline: Running
  body: Running time is logged as 'Uptime', and means the machine is operating and
    making parts. The Running time becomes the basis for the Availability portion
    of the OEE calculation.

- headline: Idle
  body: The Idle state indicates that the machine has stopped, but ShopFloorConnect
    does not (yet) know why. Idle time is converted to downtime or changeover when
    the machine operator selects a downtime reason. When OEE is calculated, any unconverted
    Idle time it treated as Unplanned Down

- headline: Unplanned Downtime
  body: The machine is stopped, the reason for the stoppage has been reported to ShopFloorConnect,
    and the reason had been previously assigned to the Unplanned downtime state. Unplanned
    downtime causes the OEE software to reduce the “Availability” percentage.

- headline: Planned Downtime
  body: The machine is stopped, the reason for the stoppage has been reported to ShopFloorConnect,
    and the reason had been previously assigned to the Planned Downtime state. Planned
    downtime logged by the OEE system DOES NOT affect the “Availability” calculation.

- headline: Changeover
  body: The machine is stopped, the reason for the stoppage has been reported to ShopFloorConnect,
    and the reason had been previously assigned to the Changeover (Setup)state. The
    ShopFloorConnect OEE software allows the user to decide whether Changeover is
    logged as planned or unplanned downtime. When logged as unplanned downtime, the
    OEE software will reduce the availability percentage for any Changeover time logged
    by the system.
