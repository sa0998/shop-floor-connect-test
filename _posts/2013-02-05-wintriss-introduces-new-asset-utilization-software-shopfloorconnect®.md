**_ShopFloorConnect Automatically Logs Downtime and Reasons in Real Time_**

ACTON, Mass., February 5, 2013 - Wintriss Controls Group is a leading manufacturer of data collection software widely used in the metal forming industry. The new ShopFloorConnect software features expanded capabilities for the discrete manufacturing, packaging, and food and beverage industries. ShopFloorConnect is now collecting data from metal stamping presses, press-brakes, laser cutting machines, turret presses, machining centers, automated saws, welders, injection molders, paint lines, and packaging machines amongst others.

ShopFloorConnect displays real-time status information for all machines on your PC or mobile device - without having to install any special software. It automatically delivers reports showing downtime analysis, OEE, etc, and provides the vital real-time data that is missing from many ERP and MES systems.

ShopFloorConnect is a turn-key solution that is scalable and flexible, and can be quickly implemented into any discrete manufacturing environment. It comes factory-configured to communicate directly over your LAN with the ShopFloorConnect Machine Interface (SMI).

The ShopFloorConnect Machine Interface (SMI) is installed on any machine, and using only two readily-available control signals can track the machine's operating status, production rate, and parts count (where applicable) - all with no operator involvement . It also has a touch-screen display which allows the operator to select a downtime reason from a user-configured menu. The SMI has built-in Ethernet connectivity to communicate with the ShopFloorConnect server over your existing network.
